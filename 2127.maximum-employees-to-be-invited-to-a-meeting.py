#
# A company is organizing a meeting and has a list of n employees, waiting to
# be invited. They have arranged for a large circular table, capable of seating
# any number of employees.
#
# The employees are numbered from 0 to n - 1. Each employee has a favorite
# person and they will attend the meeting only if they can sit next to their
# favorite person at the table. The favorite person of an employee is not
# themself.
#
# Given a 0-indexed integer array favorite, where favorite[i] denotes the
# favorite person of the i^th employee, return the maximum number of employees
# that can be invited to the meeting.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: favorite = [2,2,1,2]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# The above figure shows how the company can invite employees 0, 1, and 2, and
# seat them at the round table.
# All employees cannot be invited because employee 2 cannot sit beside
# employees 0, 1, and 3, simultaneously.
# Note that the company can also invite employees 1, 2, and 3, and give them
# their desired seats.
# The maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting is 3.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: favorite = [1,2,0]
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# Each employee is the favorite person of at least one other employee, and the
# only way the company can invite them is if they invite every employee.
# The seating arrangement will be the same as that in the figure given in
# example 1:
# - Employee 0 will sit between employees 2 and 1.
# - Employee 1 will sit between employees 0 and 2.
# - Employee 2 will sit between employees 1 and 0.
# The maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting is 3.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: favorite = [3,0,1,4,1]
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# The above figure shows how the company will invite employees 0, 1, 3, and 4,
# and seat them at the round table.
# Employee 2 cannot be invited because the two spots next to their favorite
# employee 1 are taken.
# So the company leaves them out of the meeting.
# The maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting is 4.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# n == favorite.length
# 2 <= n <= 10^5
# 0 <= favorite[i] <=Â n - 1
# favorite[i] != i
